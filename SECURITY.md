# Security Policy

## Supported versions
We aim to support the latest minor/patch release on the main branch. Security fixes will generally be backported to the most recent stable tag when feasible.

## Reporting a vulnerability
Please report security issues responsibly by emailing:

security@koyan.example (placeholder)

If email is unavailable, open a GitHub Security Advisory (private) instead of a public issue. Provide:
- A detailed description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce or a proof of concept
- Affected versions and environment details

We will acknowledge receipt within 3 business days and keep you informed of progress. Once a fix is available, we will coordinate disclosure and credit.

## Disclosure
We prefer coordinated disclosure to allow time for users to upgrade safely. Critical issues may prompt an out-of-band patch release.
